Artificial neural networks can be:
forward //
recurrent //
used for classification //
self-organizing //

The advantage of hill climbing in its basic form is:
guaranteed convergence to the global optimum
guaranteed convergence //
high classification success rate
speed of solving high-dimensional problems

Informed state space search:
Can be implemented by Dijkstra's algorithm.
Can be implemented by the Greedy search algorithm. //
Can be implemented by the A* algorithm. //
Requires a heuristic function. //

The probability of accepting a deteriorating change in simulated annealing depends on:
the magnitude of the deterioration //
temperature //
inertia
time

For classification:
Its output is a real number.
Its output is an element of a finite set. //
It is currently being replaced by regression.
It can be implemented by the k-NN algorithm. //
Its output is a tree
it is a method of learning without a teacher

The planning problem in STRIPS is given by a quartet (P, A, I, G), this quartet represents:
the set of atoms, the solution finding algorithm, the input, the final state
the planning algorithm, the set of atoms, the input, the end state
set of atoms, set of actions, initial state, final state //
set of atoms, solution search algorithm, input, end state

Finding the shortest path in the state space without evaluating actions is guaranteed by the algorithm:
BFS //
Hill climbing
DFS
Greedy search
